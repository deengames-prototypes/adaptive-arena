# BioBot

What is BioBot? A single-player roguelite arena battler with adaptive difficulty, and no "reset to zero" on death. You just keep going. Inspired by [this article](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FabianFischer/20181030/326624/The_Reset_Problem_A_Case_for_Singleplayer_Matchmaking.php).

- A roguelite arena game with monsters, traps, environmental obstacles, and skills (you grow/build over time)
- There's no reset, you die and start a new game and pick up as you were, in a brand new area
- The game transparently tells you what your skill levels are and the delta eg. +1 or -3 this round

# Story

- It's the future. Earth is toast. Everyone left alive lives on a giant spaceship, the Ark.
- We're sending out expeditions to get resources that we can use for our survival on Ark.
- Human beings have created "BioDroids," advanced creatures that can modify their flesh to become whatever the pilot wants.
- Pilots insert their consciousness into these droids and send them out to battle.
- You play a pilot in search of resources, sent to planet after planet.
